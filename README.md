CyanogenMod 10.2 for LG870 / US780 / Fx1
=======================================

CyanogenMod10.2 device tree for the fx1 was based off 985hPaKicK's (LG Optimus LTE2). It has been edited to fit the needs of the LG Optimus F7/LTE3

Build requirements:
* device/lge/msm8960-common, Branch cm10.2
* vendor/lge/fx1, Branch master

Working:
Nothing, It will build fine but you'll have to grabbed a stock zv5 kernel and build it along with it. Might run into some header files on the way;) good luck im 86'ing this project.
